## Why use BASH on the IBM i?
BASH on the IBM i has a multitude of advantages.

Just to name a couple
- it retains your command history
- search for prior executed command/scripts
- auto-completion of commands and script names
- ...

You know you executed yesterday a specific command, but can't remember what it was?
- Keep hitting the arrow-up key until you find it

You are looking for a specific command, but only remember the first 5 letters?
- Hit CTRL-R and start typing, if the wrong variant of your command shows, hit CTRL-R again until the correct command appears

Instead of typing the complete script name (e.g. MyAwesomeScriptIWantToExecute.sh)...
- Start typing only the first letters (e.g. My) and hit the TAB key
